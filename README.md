I like hoarding data online. This is how all that crap gets saved. It's a simple collection of scripts to parse, format, and upload data to various databases on a [Hasura](https://hasura.io) server. This is built using [Hono](https://honojs.dev) deployed to a [Cloudflare Worker](https://workers.cloudflare.com).
